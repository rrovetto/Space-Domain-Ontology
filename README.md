# The Space Domain Ontology (SDO)

The SDO is an ontology of the space domain, of the space environment. The ontology name is general enough to encompass various astronomical and astronautical domains. It is to include (or import) different space entity classes or ontologies for space objects, space processes, space patterns, their interrelations, etc. If you find value in my work, please [support/donate here](https://gogetfunding.com/creating-meaning-full-space-terminologies-knowledge-models-for-space-safety/).

## Note
As such it encompasses a Space Object Ontology (e.g. see rrovetto/SOO, and other repositories), as a part. 
Additionally, the SDO may be treated as a top-level ontology for the space domain, whereby the space domain is construed broadly to encompass astronomy, astronautics, space situational awareness and so on. Astronomical object classes, such as Planet, would then be included in this most general space ontology. The SDO may be equivalent to the Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO) in a similar sense (see my other repositories), such that the names 'SDO' and 'SSAO' would be synonymous. Further development required. In general, As I've conceived it, thus far, SDO is most general, followed by SSAO, and then SOO. Further development required on these considerations.

## Status
Seeking opportunities to sustainably develop this long-standing project. Seeking...
* funding, 
* partners/colleagues/co-workers/collaborators
* PhD or MS fellowship, or 
* a employment or job

...to realize the concept

CONTEXT: This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived the concept (see my orbital debris ontology repository) (Documentation, including references, verifying this five-year ideation is available upon request). Since then I've been seeking a sustainable opportunity (employment, PhD post, research position, etc.) to work on, develop, and implement this with others. I have developed a number of papers on this to make it a Phd project. Interested potential co-authors are welcome to contact me.
